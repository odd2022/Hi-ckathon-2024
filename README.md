# Hi-ckathon-2024

As part of my master's program, I participated in a hackathon focused on environmental and climate-related challenges. The objective was to develop a predictive model to estimate groundwater levels during the summer, using historical data from previous years.

## Context
Groundwater is a critical resource for managing water supplies, especially during summer droughts. Accurately forecasting groundwater levels helps plan water usage, prevent shortages, and support sustainable water resource management. This challenge, rooted in the pressing issues of climate change, required a combination of skills in machine learning, data analysis, and an understanding of hydrological processes.
